# Academy4WebProject

A simple Spring MVC Project developed during an Academy I attended a few years ago which encompasses the basic concepts
of developing a web application using Spring MVC Framework.

To run this project you need to install, on your local pc, the following tools:
- MYSQL 8.0.40.0 (It is recommended to install a client like Dbeaver or MySQL Workbench)
- Apache Tomcat 9.0.98 Server
- Smart Tomcat, an Intellij IDEA plugin which will auto config the classpath for tomcat server

Set in VM Options the following properties:
- -DdatabaseSchema=&lt;your db schema&gt;
- -DdatabaseUser=&lt;your db user&gt;
- -DdatabasePassword=&lt;your db password&gt;

The JDK used in this project is 1.8 (Java 8).
